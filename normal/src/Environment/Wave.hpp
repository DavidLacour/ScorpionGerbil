/**
 * @class Wave
 * @brief Represents a sensory wave emitted by Scorpions to detect prey
 * 
 * The Wave class simulates a propagating mechanical wave that Scorpions use 
 * for prey detection in the simulation environment. As a wave propagates outward,
 * it follows physical principles where energy decreases exponentially with distance.
 * Waves can be obstructed by obstacles, causing them to split into multiple arcs.
 * 
 * The wave mechanics include:
 * - Expanding radius over time based on wave speed
 * - Energy diminishing exponentially with distance
 * - Intensity calculated as energy divided by perimeter
 * - Collision detection with obstacles to create shadow zones
 * 
 * Scorpions use these waves as a primary sensory mechanism to locate Gerbils
 * and other potential prey in their environment, simulating the way real scorpions
 * detect vibrations through substrate-borne mechanical waves.
